## CBD Website

This is the repository for the CBD website, which can be accessed at
https://alla2021.github.io/CBD-website/

This is the source code for a website about CBD (cannabidiol), a non-psychoactive compound found in cannabis plants. The website provides information about the benefits and uses of CBD, as well as different products available on the market.

Development

The src directory contains the source code of the website. The dist directory contains the compiled code that is served to the user.

To start development, run the npm start command. This will start a local server and watch for changes in the src directory. Whenever a file is changed, the appropriate Gulp task will be executed to compile the code and reload the browser.

To build the production version of the website, run the npm run build command. This will compile the code in the src directory and output it to the dist directory. The production version of the website is optimized for performance and minified to reduce its size.
